# Final Project for the Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing course at ENSAE Paris

This project has been done by Chloé SEKKAT (ENSAE \& ENS Paris-Saclay) and Jocelyn BEAUMANOIR (ENSAE \& ESSEC).  

# Problem framing

In this project we chose to take a **scientific** approach in which we want the performances of CANINE, the first pre-trained 
tokenization-free and vocabulary-free encoder, that operates directly on character sequences without explicit tokenization.
It seeks to generalize beyond the orthographic forms encountered during pre-training. We want to compare its performances
on several downstream tasks and against several SOTA models. We will focus on two main fields: Question Answering (QA) \& 
Sentiment Analysis/Classification (SC). 

For QA, we are interested in 5 downstream tasks: simple extractive QA on SQuADv2, generalization in zero-shot transfer
settings on multilingual data, robustness to noise, domain adaptation and resistance to adversarial attacks.

Fo SC, we are primarily interested in binary classification using the well-known SST-2 dataset and robustness to noise.

Each time the experiment protocol is similar: 

- encode the dataset using the tokenizer associated to each model
- ...

Define the context in which you want your project to be
Frame and Write down one or several key questions that you’ll try to answer based on the data you will choose and the 
experiments you will run. 
Define and explain a clear experiment protocol to answer those questions (what techniques you will use, based on what 
tasks, what models, what preprocessing, what training, what evaluation you intend to do)
