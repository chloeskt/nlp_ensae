# Final Project for the Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing course at ENSAE Paris

This project has been done by Chloé SEKKAT (ENSAE \& ENS Paris-Saclay) and Jocelyn BEAUMANOIR (ENSAE \& ESSEC).  

# Problem framing
Define the context in which you want your project to be
Frame and Write down one or several key questions that you’ll try to answer based on the data you will choose and the 
experiments you will run. 
Define and explain a clear experiment protocol to answer those questions (what techniques you will use, based on what 
tasks, what models, what preprocessing, what training, what evaluation you intend to do) 

# Datasets

# Descriptive statistics

# Embedding techniques

# Task specific modeling

# Baselines

# Evaluation: both quantitative and qualitative

# Time and space complexity and cost

# Experiments

# Results 

# Future directions
