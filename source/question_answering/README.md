# Question Answering with CANINE

We used a custom wrapper around the HuggingFace Trainer so that our pipeline is cleaner. If you want to see how to implement
manually the training pipeline for Question Answering for CANINE model, please look at the ``train_canine`` function in 
``question_answering/utils/training_utils.py``.

## Description

In this section, we are interested by the capacities of CANINE versus BERT-like models such as BERT, mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa 
on Question Answering tasks. CANINE is a pre-trained tokenization-free and vocabulary-free encoder, that operates directly 
on character sequences without explicit tokenization. It seeks to generalize beyond the orthographic forms encountered 
during pre-training.

We evaluate its capacities on extractive question answering (select minimal span answer within a context) on SQuAD dataset. 
The latter is a unilingual (English) dataset available in Hugging Face (simple as load_dataset("squad_v2")). Obtained 
F1-scores are being compared to BERT-like models (BERT, mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa).

A second step is to assess its capacities of generalization in the context of zero-shot transfer. Finetuned on an English 
dataset and then directly evaluated on a multi-lingual dataset with 11 languages of various morphologies (XQuAD).

A third experiment is to test the abilities of CANINE to handle noisy inputs, especially noisy questions as in real life 
settings the questions are often noisy (misspellings, wrong grammar, etc - think of ASR systems or keyboard error while 
typing).

## Results \& Observations

### Finetuning on SQuADv2

|          | **CANINE-C** | **CANINE-S** | **mBERT** | **BERT** | **XLM-RoBERTa** |
|:--------:|:------------:|:------------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------------:|
| F1-score | 74,1         |     72,5     | 77,51     | 76,02    | 78,3            |
| EM score | 69,2         |     69,6     | 74,1      | 73,08    | 75,12           |

In this settings, CANINE performs decently well  (especially CANINE-c i.e. CANINE trained with Autoregressive Character Loss).

### Zero-shot transfer

In this setting, CANINE does not perform very well. On average it is -20 F1 lower than XLM-RoBERTa and -10 F1 lower than mBERT 
even if we expected CANINE to perfom better since it operates on characters and hence is free of the constraints of manually 
engineered tokenizers (which often do not work well for some languages e.g. for languages that do not use whitespaces 
such as Thai or Chinese) and fixed vocabulary. The gap between XLM-RoBERTa and CANINE-C increases when evaluated on 
languages such as Vietnamese, Thai or Chinese. These languages are mostly isolating ones i.e. language with a morpheme 
per word ratio close to one and almost no inflectional morphology.

### Noisy questions on SQuADv2

In this experience, the goal is to evaluate the models' robustness of noise. To do so, we created 3 noisy versions of
the SQuADv2 dataset where the questions have been artificially enhanced with noisy (in our case we chose ``RandomCharAug``
from ``nlpaug`` library with action `substitute` but in our package 4 other types of noise have been developed - refer to `processing/noisifier.py`).

Three levels of noise were chosen: 10\%, 20\% and 40\% (similar to NLI and Sentiment Analysis experiments). Each word
gets transformed with probability $p$ into a misspelled version of it (see [nlpaug documentation](https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug/blob/master/nlpaug/augmenter/char/random.py)
for more information).

The noise is **only** applied to the test set (on SQuADv2) made of 1187 examples. We compared the 5 models we finetuned 
on the clean version of SQuADv2 (first experiment) on these 3 noisy datasets (on for each level of $p$). The following
table gathers the results (averaged over 3 runs):

| **Type of noise: RandomCharAug - substitute** 	| **Noise level 10%** 	|        	| **Noise level 20%** 	|        	| **Noise level 40%** 	 | 	        |
|-----------------------------------------------	|---------------------	|--------	|---------------------	|--------	|-----------------------|----------|
|                                               	| **F1 score**        	| **EM** 	| **F1 score**        	| **EM** 	| **F1 score**        	 | **EM** 	 |
| **CANINE-C**                                  	| 69,64               	| 66,89  	| 67,88               	| 65,43  	| 66,03               	 | 63,9   	 |
| **CANINE-S**                                  	| 72,25               	| 69,65  	| 70,3                	| 68,03  	| **67,18**           	 | 64,6   	 |
| **BERT**                                      	| 73,68               	| 70,79  	| 71,22               	| 68,55  	| 66,42               	 | 63,74  	 |
| **mBERT**                                     	| 74                  	| 70,75  	| 71,66               	| 68,46  	| 67,08               	 | 64,74  	 |
| **XLM-RoBERTa**                               	| **74,54**           	| 71,61  	| **72,68**           	| 69,81  	| **67,12**           	 | 64,43  	 |

Overall XLM-RoBERTa is a very powerful model, it is the best in all experiences we attempted. However it is worth 
highlighting that once the noise level is high (i.e. > 40\%), both CANINE-C and CANINE-S perform similarly to BERT-like 
models. CANINE-S is even better than mBERT and BERT. CANINE-S does seem to fairly robust to high level of 
artificial noise. 

Further experiments should be run with other types of noise to confirm these results.

### Few-shot learning and domain adaptation

The goal of this experiment is to measure the ability of CANINE (and other models) to transfer to unseen data, in 
another domain. This could either be done in zero-shot or few-shot settings. Here we decided to go with the latter as it 
is more realistic. In real life, a company might already have a custom small database of labeled documents and questions 
associated (manually created) but would want to deploy a Question Answering system on the whole unlabeled database. The 
CUAD dataset is perfect for this task as it is highly specialized (legal domain, legal contract review). The training set 
is made of 22450 question/context pairs and the test set of 4182. We randomly selected 1\% of the training set (224 examples) 
to train on for 3 epochs, using the previously finetuned models on SQuADv2. Then each model was evaluated on 656 test examples. 
Results are reported in the following table and to ensure fair comparison, all models where trained and tested on the 
exact same examples. 

|                 	| **F1 score** 	| **EM score** 	|
|:---------------:	|:------------:	|:------------:	|
|     **BERT**    	|     74.18    	|     72.72    	|
|   **RoBERTa**   	|     73.83    	|     72.24    	|
|  **DistilBERT** 	|     72.86    	|     71.37    	|
|    **mBERT**    	|     74.50    	|     73.12    	|
| **XLM-RoBERTa** 	|     76.64    	|     73.44    	|
|   **CANINE-C**  	|     72.51    	|     71.39    	|
|   **CANINE-S**  	|     72.27    	|     71.27    	|

### Few-shot learning and adversarial attacks

This last Question Answering-related experiment aims at testing CANINE abilities not to be fooled in adversarial settings. 
We decided to us the  dynabench/QA dataset (BERT-version). The latter is an adversarially collected Reading Comprehension 
dataset spanning over multiple rounds of data collect. It has been made so that SOTA NLP models find it challenging. 

We decided to take models finetuned on SQuADv2, take 200 examples (2\%) extracted from dynabench/qa training set to train 
each model for 3 epochs and then evaluate these models on 600 test examples (60\% of the full test set).Our results are 
displayed in the following table. Again, to ensure fair comparison, all models are trained on the exact same examples 
and evaluated on the same ones.

|                 	| **F1 score** 	| **EM score** 	|
|:---------------:	|:------------:	|:------------:	|
|     **BERT**    	|     38.13    	|     25.6     	|
|   **RoBERTa**   	|   **47.47**  	|     35.8     	|
|  **DistilBERT** 	|     32.64    	|     22.5     	|
|    **mBERT**    	|     38.43    	|     28.6     	|
| **XLM-RoBERTa** 	|     36.51    	|     27.6     	|
|   **CANINE-C**  	|     28.25    	|     18.6     	|
|   **CANINE-S**  	|     27.40    	|     17.2     	|

Finally, we observed that CANINE models are much more prone to adversarial attacks (-10F1 points compared to data2vec and 
BERT). It is yet unclear for us why it is the case. Surely this is due to the fact that CANINE is tokenization-free but, 
we still need to build intuition on why this has a great impact when evaluated on adversarial samples.
